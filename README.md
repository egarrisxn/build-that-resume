# Build That Resume

Build That Resume is a simple resume builder web application built using Next.js, TailwindCSS, Material-Tailwind, and TypeScript. It allows users to create professional resumes quickly and efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs quickly.
- **Material-Tailwind:** A Material Design UI kit for TailwindCSS, providing pre-designed components.
- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced code maintainability and scalability.

- ## JSON Data and Image Upload

To maintain flexibility and ease of updating resume data, Build That Resume keeps the resume content in a seperate repository, consisting of a JSON file and an Images folder.

- **JSON Data:** The resume data is stored in a JSON file, allowing for easy updates without modifying the application code directly.
- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images to include in the resume JSON file, such as an avatar image or screenshots of projects.
